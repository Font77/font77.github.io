====== zust message output phur ruby sass ====
        Ruby Sass has reached end-of-life and should no longer be used.

        * If you use Sass as a command-line tool, we recommend using Dart Sass, the new
          primary implementation: https://sass-lang.com/install

        * If you use Sass as a plug-in for a Ruby web framework, we recommend using the
          sassc gem: https://github.com/sass/sassc-ruby#readme

        * For more details, please refer to the Sass blog:
          https://sass-lang.com/blog/posts/7828841

        Post-install message from html-pipeline:
        -------------------------------------------------
        Thank you for installing html-pipeline!
        You must bundle Filter gem dependencies.
        See html-pipeline README.md for more details.

_data: Where you can store data files for things like skills, projects, work history, and so on.
_drafts: Add this to your .gitignore and store your blog post drafts in here (optional).
    _includes: Where you define Jekyll includes, which are sort of like reusable HTML components.
    _layouts: HTML layouts define the structure of your site and can be nested in one another.
    _posts: Where you’ll store all of your blog posts as Markdown files.
    _sass: This is where your SASS partials go. You’ll then need to import them in _assets/main.scss.
    _site: Jekyll’s auto-generated build directory, which houses your final, compiled site. It’s not pushed to GitHub because it’s in .gitignore.
    _assets: Mainly for storing images and scripts, but it can also house a main CSS file.

You may be wondering why all of these directory names are prefixed by an underscore. A directory with a leading underscore is special and won’t get processed by Jekyll. As a result, it won’t appear in the build directory, _site/.
==================================================
* Liquid: site.title, site.description, site.url
